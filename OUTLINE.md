administrative  organizational tasks.

### Layers of Inclusion

1. Voting
1. Immutable Legal Document History
1. Self Governance with smart contracting.

#### Voting
Utilizing the blockchain for voting an organization can immediately add
an immutable and verified voting history.

#### Legal Documentsj
Building on the immutable and verified voting history we insert the
commit hash of a repo with legal documents in it, a pull repuest is made
from this branch the electorate then votes on this PR and if successful
the branch is merge into the mainline and the tally is hashed along with
the merging PR, and a final summary is signed by gpg, squashed and
merged into the master history.

#### Self Governing with Contributor Tokens

The third layer to be included would be to codify the bylaws into smart
contracts and implement the contributor token self governance.
